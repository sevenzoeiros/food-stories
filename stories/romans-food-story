# Anne-Tastic Women

Anne Bolger-Witherspoon describes her relationship to food and family throughout her life. As a second-generation New Mexican, we discussed hippie mamas, chicken repulsion, having and raising children, travel, and sugar addiction. 



## She Found the Name for Her First Baby 

When Hawthorn was still in utero, Anne was in need of some herbal rememdies to ease the effects of pregnacy. Her midwife recommended hawthorn berry supplements to lower her blood pressure. Hawthorn was born in New York and is absolutely a person that's good for the heart, so her name speaks volumes about her character. 




## Analysis: Named Identities and Motherhood


	Anne Bolger-Witherspoon became a stellar figure in my life at the dawn of my friendship with her eldest daughter in 2021. Hawthorn is the precious name of this precious person; a name functioning as an identity marker borrowed from the ancient and medicinal hawthorn berries. This essay explores how women — often through the rhythms of cooking, care-giving, and daily nourishment — shape family identity, sometimes intentionally and sometimes quietly through habit.
	Anne produced two third-generation New Mexican daughters, and she herself is one of two second-generation New Mexican sisters. Her and her sibling Sarah were raised slaughtering chickens their family raised and eating organic home-grown vegetables. Her family lives on the same compound in the South Valley, with a farm that centers the community brilliantly. Her adolescent experiences left a lasting impact on Anne's way of being. Having a hippie-dippie mama is no joke! Mama Sheila (LaLa) was a member of the CO-OP, and created her own kombucha, yogurt, and fresh bread; so school lunches and gas station candies were wildly special treats for her. Memories of killing the chickens and gathering their eggs pervade Anne's mind still to this day.... resulting in a ripe revulsion at the thought of cooking with them. Disgusts as such have culminated into modern eating standards and alternative traditions, such as vegetarian Thanksgivings.
Eating in more practical manners surged when Sheila dove into the workforce. Anne and Sarah were nearly out of elementary school when they experienced that transition — a change that shifted their entire value on the allotment of Time. As written by Jeff Pratt in Food Values, "value has two moments: the creative action or energy, and the ‘congealed’ result of that action, stored in objects and localities"; with Sheila's departure of a mainly domestic life, food's value diminished for there was simply much less time to take care of such intensive culinary preparations. Daniel the Dad would fry up hot-dogs as a staple dinner. 
When it's time to make an ofrenda for Dia de Los Muertos in November, Anne honors her dads' life and adorations by offering him a Squirt soda and some local red-chile chips. She advises thoughtfully considering what a commemorated person had loved most during their life, and what they would miss the most. When he would buy these adored delicacies, the girls were each allowed a single candy. When chocolates were too expensive, Anne cherished her long Jolly Rancher pops and jaw breakers. Sweet teeth seem to creep their way into the fibers of every family. 
	There are elements of ourselves that we can't help but inherit. A preference for sugar seems genetically coincidental; Hawthorn and I often bemoan how tempted sweet drinks make us. So consistently confronted with our eating habits that we often give up bothering their stability. Sugar addiction is one of these unflinching qualities, and Anne's husband is someone who's allegedly jovially addicted to the soluble carbohydrates. Jokes get made that "he's the thinnest out of everyone!". When asked what defines an addiction, Anne pointed out how Lonnie tends to be unflinchingly prepared to ingest sweet things available to him. 
At this, I asked Anne if she personally dealt with any food-related addictions. She responded, "probably", and suggested that her issue is distorted eating. In her personal relationship to nourishment, when "nobody's around to cook for, I don't necessarily make something... I don't make myself a meal" (26:26-26:49). Convenience kicks in, and rapidly sustaining energy and fulfillment overcome the timeliness demanded by laboring in the kitchen. One must wonder how this distortion forms. Does motherhood directly skew one's willingness to cook solo when they've been so consistently made obligated to prepare sustaining meals for those primarily under their responsibility? 
	When Anne first had Hawthorn, she was living in New York. Molly Katzen's Moosewood cookbook aided many of her Kitchen Actions. While pregnant, she experienced those uncomfortable motherly sensations where her nutrients were getting positively slurped from her Being --- so she called in the midwife. This fine lady recommended hawthorn berries to aid in lowering Anne's blood pressure; which turned out to be a massive success! With no name decided for her soon-to-be-born baby, she and Lonnie settled on Hawthorn. When the family first visited Shanghai during some early 2000's winter months to take care of an advertising job, they experienced how much of an impact a food can play within a culture. Countless stands of vendors serving skewered hawthorn berries dipped in molten sugar turned crystallized helps to reveal how the berry acts as a mother of its own to cultural devotion. 
How someone interacts with foodstuffs definitively impacts their own self perception and how they're received by others. Anne's youth was largely defined by her access to farm-produced goods, guided by a mother who engaged directly with the available ingredients to nourish her family. By keeping her own family in that South Valley, NM home, Anne continues perpetuating her heritage. Her daughters, Hawthorn and Cheyenne, host names rife with significance and prove that Anne is the perfect example of how food can shape identity for oneself and their family. 
"My mom has this phrase which she often says; she says, 'eatin' food is soon forgotten'." (Anne; interview; 29:28-29:55)
